# Calculator

This Project was pretty hard to realise, but i'm pretty happy with the current state it is at. I didn't implement the keydown eventlisteners for the operations, since the keys on different computers have different event.code values, which could be a feature to be implemented in the future. Adding a blinking effect to the result of a calculation would also be a cool idea to try. 

I tried out a funky layout for the calculator. Click [here](https://ank-ai.github.io/Calculator/) if you want to try it out ðŸ§®ðŸ¤“
